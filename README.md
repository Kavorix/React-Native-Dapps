[`create-react-native-dapp`](https://github.com/cawfree/create-react-native-dapp) is an `npx` utility to help quickly bootstrap [**React Native ⚛️**](https://reactnative.dev) applications with access to the [**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain.

Our goal is to help create a sustainable open source ecosystem for [`Web3`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) in React Native by providing a dependable common runtime which we can build upon and extend together.

### 🔥 Features

- 🚀 Bootstrapped by Expo.
  - Easily take advantage of Expo's high quality, well-supported and well-documented library architecture.
- 🍫 Served with Ganache.
  - Your generated app comes with a simple example contract which you can deploy and interact with _directly from your app_.
- 🏗️ And it's strictly typed.
  - It comes preconfigured with TypeScript to help write applications that _scale_.

And this is just the _beginning_.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You don't have to install anything, just run the following command:

```
npx create-react-native-dapp
```

This will walk you through the creation of your Ethereum-enabled application, which works on [**Android**](https://reactnative.dev), [**iOS**](https://reactnative.dev) and the [**Web**](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). The resulting project has been `eject`ed from [**Expo**](https://expo.io) and merged with [**Truffle Suite**](https://www.trufflesuite.com/).
