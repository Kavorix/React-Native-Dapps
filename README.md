[`create-react-native-dapp`](https://github.com/cawfree/create-react-native-dapp) is an `npx` utility to help quickly bootstrap [**React Native ⚛️**](https://reactnative.dev) applications with access to the [**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain.

Our goal is to help create a sustainable open source ecosystem for [`Web3`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) in React Native by providing a dependable common runtime which we can _buidl_ upon and extend **together**.

### 🔥 Features

- 🚀 **Bootstrapped by Expo.**
  - Easily take advantage of Expo's high quality, well-supported and well-documented library architecture.
  - Supports Android, iOS and the Web.
- 🍫 **Served with Ganache.**
  - Your generated app comes with a simple example contract which you can deploy and interact with directly.
- 🏗️ **And it's strictly typed.**
  - It comes pre-configured with TypeScript to help write applications that _scale_.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You don't have to install anything, just run the following command:

```
npx create-react-native-dapp
```

This will walk you through the creation of your Ethereum-enabled application, which works on [**Android**](https://reactnative.dev), [**iOS**](https://reactnative.dev) and the [**Web**](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). The resulting project has been `eject`ed from [**Expo**](https://expo.io) and merged with [**Truffle Suite**](https://www.trufflesuite.com/).
